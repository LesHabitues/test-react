# test-react

Integrate the screen below as best as you can.

- Request the data from the route : https://www.leshabitues.fr/testapi/shops
- Parse the response
- Create any Components you might find necessary as the layout with logo, name, address and maxoffer amount will be reused.
- Add a loader and error handling in case the network is slow or api is down.
- Add a link, button or pull-to-refresh to update the Shop list content in one click.
- You can use Typescript, Redux, StyledComponents... or any other package you might find useful and helpful.

## Rules to follow
-  You must commit regularly so we can follow your progress with an initial empty commit when you start the test
-  Use the font [Lato Regular](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) and the following colors : `#4A90E2`,`#C4C4C4`

## Deliverables

-   the link to the git repository
-   several commits, with an explicit message each time
-   a separate file or email documenting your process and principles you've followed
