## Goal

The goal of the test is to create a list of shops, using the following libraries:
- React, TypeScript
- Redux
- react-hook-form for forms.
- Sass

#### Rules

- You must use Redux to store and update your data.
- For each shop in the list you must display at least logo, name, address and his best offer.
- The list must display 10 items per page and must be paginated.
- A form to add a new shop to the list.

##### Bonus

You can make shops in the list editable with the form.

Feel free to use any other libraries if you feel like it :

A good code quality is expected and a good design is appreciate.
